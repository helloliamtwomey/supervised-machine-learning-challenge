# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

## Introduction
In this project, we use machine learning models to predict the credit risk of given loans. Specifically, we will be comparing the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

## Files
The following files are included in this project:

'Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb': This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code used to import the data, split it into training and testing sets, and create, fit, and compare the models.
'Resources/lending_data.csv': This file contains the raw data used in the analysis.

## Usage
To run the analysis, open 'Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook. All necessary dependencies are listed in the first cell of the notebook.

## Results
The analysis produces two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. We compare the performance of the two models to see which one is better at predicting the credit risk of loans.

## Conclusion
Thank you for checking out the Supervised Machine Learning Challenge project! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to us.
